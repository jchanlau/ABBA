# ABBA: an Agent-Based Model of the Banking System

![alt text](https://github.com/jchanlauimf/ABBA/blob/master/img/ABBA-wide.JPG)

## Description


ABBA is an agent-based model for analyzing risks in the banking system in which banks’ business decisions drive the endogenous formation of interbank networks. ABBA allows for a rich menu of banks’ decisions, contingent on banks’ balance sheet and capital position, including dividend payment rules, credit expansion, and dynamic balance sheet adjustment via risk-weight optimization. The platform serves to illustrate the effect of changes on regulatory requirements on solvency, liquidity, and interconnectedness risk. It could also constitute a basic building block for further development of large, bottom-up agent-based macro-financial models.

The model is described fully in this [working paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2784228) available from SSRN. The LibreOffice presentation also summarizes the main features of the model
